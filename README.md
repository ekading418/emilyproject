## Welcome to my first project

I am hoping to explore UNESCO/UN data for a variety of countries between the years 2005 - 2015.
I am primarily interested in the **% of R&D workers that are female** compared to other stats, like **Life Ladder (happiness measurement), Log GDP per capita, Fertility rate**, etc.

I will post more visualizations as I create them.
